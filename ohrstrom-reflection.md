* What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

Thankfully for my Guide, Davina, I was able to really wrap my head around the differences between Forking and Cloning. Particularly when sending push requests - I had to create, in my mind, a map of what exactly (branch or file) is being included in this push.

Davina was very helpful in explaining the in-context uses of these git commands, which helped paint that map for me.

Getting more experience in cloning repos, fetching from github other collaborators' changes, will be very helpful in furthering my understanding of the concept.

* What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

Other than the above concept, my GPS helped explain the git cycle. I was able to inquire to what frequency a programmer should commit changes - is it something that should occur every 15 minutes / 30 minutes / day?

Davina helped explain each programmer differs from one another, but a good habit would be commit early, and often.

Especially when discussing merge conflicts, it seems a team can really be their own worst enemy with bad committing habits.

After reading the [suggested StackOverflow forum](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16490873/how-to-avoid-git-conflicts-in-a-team) on git conflicts, there seem to be a few complimentary methods that may reduce these conflicts:

1. Enforcing Whitespace Conventions
2. Coherent formatting and keyboard settings in an IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
3. Effective Communication & Project Management

Figuring out which ones, and to what degree depend on the company and the project.
